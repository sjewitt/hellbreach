# hellbreach

For Doom 2.

This folder contains standalone MAP01 versions of hellbreach WADs. They *should* be pistol-start playable, except perhaps hb_4.wad.

They are all in ZDoom/Hexen format 'cos I wanted to muck about with ACS scripts. Pretty vanilla at the moment though.

## Current contents

**hb_1.wad** 
Breach containment facility. First map made. 

*Notes:*
 - moved to MAP01
 - redesigned last exterior area before exit.
 - Secret exit removed

**hb_2.wad** 
Breach scars. A canyon exterior design. Quite a bit of exploring and switch finding to open gates. 

*Notes:*
 - moved to MAP01
 - Exterior design an extension of hb_1.wad end section

**hb_3.wad** 
Hell's Atrium (?). UNFINISHED.

Marble design, with inaccessible parts of hb_4.wad. 

*Notes:*
 - moved to MAP01
 - designed to be the inacessible parts of hb_4.wad 

**hb_4.wad** 
Hell's Atrium secret area (?). Marble design, with inaccessible but visible parts of hb_4.wad. 

*Notes:*
 - moved to MAP01
 - supposed to be reached by the secret exit of hb_1.wad once combined into a multi-level WAD.
 - Is supposed to include the inacessible but visible parts of hb_3.wad. 
    - I might investigate turning this all into a Hexen-style hub...
